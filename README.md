# Turntable Universal Automatic Indexing Controller (TUAIC)

The purpose of this design is to retrofit universally to any model train turntable drive system,
provide automatic indexing, and exceed the current performance metrics of existing products at a
lower price point. This design uses drive system feedback to control drive motor output. It allows
for user defined/programmed positions for roundhouse stall locations and turntable track entries.
The user can select any programmed position, and the TUAIC will automatically maneuver the turntable
into the selected position.
