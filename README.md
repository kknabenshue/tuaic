# Turntable Universal Automatic Indexing Controller (TUAIC)

The purpose of this design is to retrofit universally to any model train
turntable drive system, and provide automatic indexing. This design uses
drive system feedback to control drive motor output. It allows for user
defined/programmed postitions to be used for roundhouse stall locations and
turntable track entry positions. The user can select any programmed
position, and the TUAIC will automatically maneuver the turntable into the
selected position.
